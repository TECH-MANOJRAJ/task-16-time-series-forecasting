TASK 16 – TIME SERIES FORECASTING REPORT
Dataset: Monthly Car Sales Dataset
Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/monthly-car-sales.csv

------------------------------------------------------------
1. OBJECTIVE
------------------------------------------------------------
The objective of this task was to analyze historical monthly car sales data, identify trends and seasonality patterns, and build a time-series forecasting model to predict future sales.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. DATA PREPARATION
------------------------------------------------------------
- The dataset was loaded using pandas.
- The "Month" column was renamed to "Date".
- The Date column was converted to datetime format.
- The Date column was set as the index for proper time-series analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. TREND ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------------
A line plot of monthly car sales was generated.

Observations:
- Sales showed an overall increasing trend in the early years.
- There were fluctuations indicating possible seasonal behavior.
- Some periods showed sudden drops, suggesting structural changes or economic impact.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. SEASONALITY CHECK
------------------------------------------------------------
A rolling mean (3-month window) was calculated to smooth the data.

Observation:
- The rolling mean revealed smoother patterns.
- This confirmed the presence of recurring seasonal trends in the dataset.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. TRAIN-TEST SPLIT
------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset was split into:
- 80% Training Data
- 20% Testing Data

The split was done chronologically to ensure that future data was not used to predict past data, maintaining proper time-series methodology.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. MODEL IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------------------------------------------
Two forecasting models were applied:

Model 1: Exponential Smoothing (Trend Only)
- Trend component: Additive
- Seasonal component: None

Model 2: Holt-Winters (Trend + Seasonality)
- Trend component: Additive
- Seasonal component: Additive
- Seasonal period: 12 (monthly cycle)

The Holt-Winters model performed better due to the presence of yearly seasonality.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. MODEL EVALUATION
------------------------------------------------------------
The model was evaluated using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- Measures average percentage prediction error.

Results:
MAE: [Enter Your MAE Value Here]
MAPE: [Enter Your MAPE Value Here] %

Lower values indicate better forecasting accuracy.

------------------------------------------------------------
8. FUTURE FORECASTING
------------------------------------------------------------
Using the improved Holt-Winters model, the next 12 months of car sales were forecasted.

The forecast suggests:
- Continued seasonal fluctuations.
- A moderate trend depending on recent training patterns.

Forecast results were exported to:
- forecast_output.csv
- future_12_months_forecast.csv

------------------------------------------------------------
9. CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------
The time-series analysis successfully identified both trend and seasonality in the monthly car sales data.

The Holt-Winters model provided improved forecasting accuracy compared to the simple trend-only model.

This task demonstrates how time-series forecasting can be used in business planning, demand estimation, and inventory management.
